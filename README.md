Firstly, we are creating a folder named finalproject in c drive. Next we have created a directory in djangoproject using mkdir final_project. Now, In pycharm terminal we have created a virtual environment using python -m venv venv. After creating a venv, we are opening the directory cd .\djangoproject. Now in djangoproject, we are activating virtual environment using venv\Scripts\activate we have installed django using pip install django. Here we should make sure it is installed in the same location of venv. To check weather django is installed or not we use the command django-admin version. Now we are going to start my project using django-admin startproject final_project. Here, we are opening the final_project folder using cd .\final_project. Now, we are starting the app using django-admin startapp FinalProject_App Here we have added FinalProject_App in the settings.py under installed apps. Also we have written code for views.py of FinalProject_App.Next we will write code for the urls.py in the Final_project. Now we need to copy the same urls.py code and paste it in the FinalProject_App. We will modify the code here. I have already uploaded settings.py, views.py, Final_project/urls.py, FinalProject_App/urls.py . Later I have executed the project using python manage.py runserver. Then I will get a link "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" like this in output. If we run this "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" in the browswer we will get the required output.
